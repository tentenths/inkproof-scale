# Inkproof.Scale

Linear scales and affine transforms between data space and screen space, with order-preservation, invertibility and composition proved. Part of the Inkproof charting libraries; it knows about ordered fields and intervals, never about what the data measures.

## Supported versions

| Inkproof.Scale | Lean | Lasm (`@lasm/cli`) | Inkproof.Core |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main` | `leanprover/lean4:v4.35.0` | 0.3.5 | `v0.1.0` |
| `v0.1.0` | `leanprover/lean4:v4.35.0` | 0.3.5 | `v0.1.0` |

The library builds natively and under Lasm from the same source.

## Using it

```lean
require «inkproof-scale» from git "https://github.com/tentenths/inkproof-scale" @ "v0.1.0"
```

`import Inkproof.Scale` brings in everything a program runs. `import Inkproof.Scale.Proofs` adds the published theorems, which a browser build need not link. Each definition's docstring names the theorems about it, and each theorem's docstring states it in plain English.

## Guarantees

These hold for any ordered field: a type with Lean core's `Lean.Grind.Field`, `Lean.Grind.OrderedRing`, `Std.IsLinearOrder` and `Std.LawfulOrderLT`, such as `Rat`.

- Composing two affine transforms gives one that maps every point as applying them in turn does (`Affine.comp_apply`).
- An affine transform with a nonzero slope is undone by its inverse, in both directions (`Affine.inv_apply_apply`, `Affine.apply_inv_apply`).
- An affine transform with a positive slope preserves order, and one with a negative slope reverses it (`Affine.apply_le_apply_iff_of_pos` and its variants).
- A linear scale maps its domain's start and end to its range's (`Linear.map_domainStart`, `Linear.map_domainEnd`), and agrees with its affine map (`Linear.toAffine_apply`).
- A linear scale with a nondegenerate domain and range is undone by its inverse, in both directions (`Linear.inv_map_map`, `Linear.map_inv_map`).
- A linear scale preserves order when its domain and range run the same way, and reverses it when they run opposite ways, as with screen y (`Linear.map_le_map_iff_of_increasing`, `Linear.map_le_map_iff_of_decreasing` and their strict variants).

`Float` is not covered: it is not a field, and floats are opaque to proofs. Float scales run the same code, and the tests check that rounding keeps order and that round trips land within a relative `1e-12`. A check in the tests fails if any axiom beyond Lean's own creeps in. [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) describes the design, and `API.lock` lists every public declaration and theorem statement.

## Trusted computing base

The proofs cover the Lean source. These are trusted beneath them:

| Component | Why trusted | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lean compiler and runtime | Compiles the proved source | Pinned in `lean-toolchain`; the same test program runs natively and under Lasm |
| Lasm compiler, runtime and Emscripten | Compiles Lean to Wasm | Pinned exactly in the test subproject; the same test program runs natively and under Lasm |

The library adds no axioms, and has no generated code and no hand-written JavaScript.
